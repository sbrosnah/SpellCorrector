Steps:
1. Read the text file into a dictionary
    -We want the keys to be case insensitive
    -Later, I will implement the dictionary as a Trie
 2. Load words in user input using Trie.add(String)
    -Compare the strings using Trie.find(String)
        - This will compare by recursively calling find_closest_dist_one
